### Description

A 4-way traffic intersection with traffic signals that control the flow of traffic. Each signal has a timer to dictate the time remaining for each signal color; it switches from green to yellow to red or red to green. The pixels are vehicles and they should move according to the traffic signal present. 

The plan is to create a traffic simulation with a timer that is controlled by the time of day in a fictitious Urban city, and be able to control the speed of each vehicle.

How does a random change in the time of day affect traffic?
* This simulation is based on the simulation created by Derwin Elsenique on Youtube
